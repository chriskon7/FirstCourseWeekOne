1 Create a local variable and modify it at an inner scope (in between a do/end block). You can try

a) re-assigning the variable to something else-  set local_var to three within the block and it did not change the variable outside of the block
b) call a method that doesnâ€™t mutate the caller-  Used the method uniq inside the block and it did not change the local var on outside of block
c) call a method that mutates the caller-    Used the method pop and uniq! inside block and it did change the variable on outside of block
2 Create a local variable at an inner scope (within a do/end block) and try to reference it in the outer scope.  
	Throws an error because the variable hasn't been declared at local level- `<main>': undefined local variable or method `inner_var' for main:Object (NameError)
What happens when you have nested do/end blocks?	A variable created in a nested do/end block can not be called in the do/end block it is nested in
